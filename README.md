# Lock Eyes

Share glances on any video call via a private 1:1 video side channel.

*The exact feeling Lock Eyes is going for.*

## What This Does

Lock Eyes creates a private video connection between you and one other person on a video call. You each see the other's face in a small always-on-top window via your secondary camera. You can turn off your Zoom/Teams/Meet camera and be invisible to everyone — but your person still sees you. Either of you can kill it instantly.

**Not a Zoom app. A glance app. Use it on any call.**

## How to Test This

1. Get on a Zoom call (or Teams, Meet, whatever) with your friend
2. Both open Lock Eyes
3. One clicks "Create Session" — share the 4-letter code
4. Other types the code, clicks "Join" — first person clicks "Accept"
5. Both pick their secondary camera, click "Lock Eyes"

A small window pops up showing their face. They see yours. Share glances when someone says something wild.

**To kill it:** Click the KILL button or close the reaction window. Instant. Both sides go dark.

## How to Run (Development)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in dev mode (starts Vite dev server + Electron)
npm run electron:dev

# Or run Vite and Electron separately:
# Terminal 1: npm run dev
# Terminal 2: npx electron .

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run in production mode (without dev server)
LOCK_EYES_PROD=1 npx electron . --no-sandbox

# Package as installer
npm run package:mac    # macOS .dmg
npm run package:win    # Windows .exe
npm run package:linux  # Linux .AppImage
```

## How to Test with a Friend

1. Build the app for your platform: `npm run package:linux` (or mac/win)
2. Send the installer to your friend
3. Both install and open Lock Eyes
4. Both pick your secondary camera (USB webcam, etc.)
5. One creates a session, shares the code
6. Other joins with the code
7. Host clicks Accept when the handshake request appears
8. You're live — share glances

## What You Need

- Two computers (yours + your friend's)
- Two secondary cameras (USB webcams, or your phone as a camera)
- Two monitors (or at least one person with dual monitors — the reaction window needs somewhere to live)
- A video call platform (Zoom, Teams, Meet — doesn't matter, Lock Eyes doesn't interact with it)
- **No server to run.** PeerJS public broker handles signaling.

### Tech Stack

- **Electron** — cross-platform desktop app with always-on-top window, content protection, multi-display
- **React + Vite** — UI with dark theme and amber accent
- **PeerJS** — free public signaling broker, no server to run
- **WebRTC** — P2P encrypted video, sub-500ms latency

### Connection Flow

1. **Host** clicks "Create Session" → generates 4-char code → registers as `lockeyes-<CODE>` on PeerJS broker
2. **Guest** enters code, clicks "Join" → connects to `lockeyes-<CODE>` via PeerJS data connection → sends `{type: 'request', name}`
3. **Host** receives request → sees "Katherine wants to lock eyes. Accept?" → clicks Accept
4. **Host** sends `{type: 'accept'}` → initiates `peer.call(remotePeerId, localStream)` with secondary camera
5. **Guest** receives call → answers with their local stream → both sides have remote video
6. **Reaction window** auto-opens on second display showing partner's face
7. Either side can kill: closes PeerJS peer, stops media connection, closes reaction window

### Key Design Decisions

- **PeerJS runs in the renderer**, not the main process — `getUserMedia` only works in the renderer, and PeerJS needs the MediaStream directly
- **No custom signaling server** — PeerJS public broker (`0.peerjs.com`) handles matchmaking for free
- **Camera independence** — the side channel uses a separate camera and separate `MediaStream`, completely independent of Zoom's camera toggle
- **Content protection** — the reaction window uses `setContentProtection(true)` to block screenshots and screen recording
- **`lockeyes-` prefix** on all PeerJS peer IDs prevents collision with other PeerJS users
- **Ambiguous characters excluded** from session codes (no O/0/I/1/L)

## Privacy & Safety

- **Mutual opt-in:** Both parties must accept before video flows
- **Kill switch:** Either party can sever instantly, no explanation needed
- **Camera independence:** Your Zoom camera state doesn't affect Lock Eyes
- **Screenshot protection:** Reaction window has content protection enabled
- **Status indicator:** Always know when you're being seen (green dot = LIVE)
- **No recording, no audio, no chat** — video only, ephemeral

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| "No session found for code X" | Host hasn't created a session yet, or code was mistyped |
| "Code in use" | Another session is using that code — app auto-generates a new one |
| Video doesn't connect | Check firewall/NAT. PeerJS uses Google STUN by default. May need TURN server for restrictive networks. |
| Camera not listed | Grant camera permission in OS settings. Some cameras need to be plugged in before app launch. |
| Reaction window doesn't appear | Ensure you have a second display, or drag the main window to see it |
